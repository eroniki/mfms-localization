    % An ideal antenna in an empty space with a gain of $G_t$ and radiating power of $P_t$, induces power $P_r$ in an antenna which has a gain of $G_r$
    The relationship between transmitted $P_t$ and received power $P_r$ occurred between ideal antennas in an empty space with a distance $d$ separation is characterized by Friis' Free Space Equation given below~\cite{friis1946note}.

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:friisWatts}
            P_r(d) = \dfrac{P_t  G_t  G_r \lambda^2}{{\left(4 \pi d\right)}^2}
    \end{equation}

    \noindent where $P_r(d)$ and $P_t$ denote received, and transmitted power in Watts, respectively.
    $G_t$ and $G_r$ are uniteless gains of transmitter, and receiver antenna while $\lambda$ and $d$ denote wavelength and the seperation between two antennas in meters, respectively.
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:friisdBm}
        P^{+}_r(d) = P^{+}_t + 10 \log{G_t G_r} + 20 \log{\lambda} - 20 \log{d} - 20 \log{4 \pi}
    \end{equation}
    Since the received power is miniscule level, \Cref{eq:friisdBm} represents Friis' equation in dBm level.
    $P^{+}_r(d)$ and $P^{+}_t$ represent received and transmitted powers decibel scale.
    However, Friis' equation does not hold true for the distance $d = 0$.
    Thus, received power generally denoted relative to a reference point $d_0$ with a known corresponding received power.

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:friisRef}
        P^{+}_r(d) = P^{+}_r(d_0) + 20 \log{\dfrac{d_0}{d}}
    \end{equation}

    % \begin{equation}
    %     \label{eq:pathloss}
    %     PL(d) = 10 \log{\dfrac{P_t}{P_r}}
    % \end{equation}
    On the other hand, path loss models the difference between received and transmitted power in decibel scale as positive gain.
    \Cref{eq:log-distance} represents path loss relative to a reference point.

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:log-distance}
        \overline{PL}(d) = \overline{PL}(d_0) + 10 n \log{\dfrac{d}{d_0}}
    \end{equation}

    \noindent where $n$ is the path loss exponent and varies depending on the environment.
    Please note $n = 2$ for empty space.

    % Indoor localization is an important problem in which an object of interest, i.e.\ a robot in our framework, suited with different sensors localizes itself in an indoor environment where there is no global positioning information is available.
    % \textit{The complexity of the problem significantly \# \textit{exponentially} increases as NLoS of reference AP's, presence of hard-constraints, in particular infrasractural elements such as walls and doors, noisy nature of the signals, and dynamic environments.}~\cite{liu2007survey}
    % \textit{As robotic systems find more applications in indoor areas where dynamic objects, such as other robots and humans, often coexist, it increasingly becomes important to safely and accurately localize the agent.} %where there is no reliable global positioning system is available.}
    % % \textit{Maybe co-robots can be mentioned.}
    % Thus, a great amount of interest has been showed from both academia and industry.
    % \# \textit{Do I really emphasize industry academia, actually this is a good opportunity to mention iBeacon from Apple}
    % The indoor localization systems based WiFi signal can be mainly categorized undepngr two categories: fingerprinting and model-based methods~\cite{hossain2015survey}.
    % We'll, however, only cover the fingerprinting technique due to the increasing popularity of the technique.

    \subsection{Indoor Localization Based on Fingerprinting}
    Fingerprinting-based systems are often   had been surveyed many times~\cite{he2016wi} with different scopes.
    Zee~\cite{rai2012zee}: off-the-shelf hw, crowdsourcing
    Many of the previous systems employ spatial pattern of the fingerprints, while others use temporal pattern displayed by AP's.

    % UnLoc~\cite{wang2012no}: zero supervising, no training; heavily depends on landmark extraction and dead reckoning. (mobile device)
    % One of the recent advances is that to incorporate the hard-constraints induced by the environment infrasracture.
    UnLoc~\cite{wang2012no} is an examplary instance falling into the former category.
    The system aims for incorporating hard-constraints of the environment, namely, elevators, stairs, entrances, and the change in the fingerprint patterns; for instance, a significant drop of signal level of a specific AP\@.

    While Bayesian framework was used to present the belief of the robot pose and construct signal map in the previous works, LiFS~\cite{yang2012locating} approximated the environment by a grid-based method.
    The grids are then transformed to \textit{stress-free floor plan} where the grids were clustered based on walking-distance among each other rather than physical distance; due to the fact that in indoor settings not every neighboring grids are accessible from one to another within one step.
    The fingerprints are then collected during a walk in the localization environment, as the proposed data acquisition algorithm labels fingerprints with the number of steps taken.
    The signal map were then constructed with the observed fingerprints with a Multidimensional scaling technique~\cite{borg2005modern}.
    % The fingerprints are then clustered with the same multiscaling algorithm, after a tedious preprosessing step.
    After acquiring fingerprint space and stress-free floor plan, the correspondence between two information was then calculated to map one to another; thus, spatial information was tied to fingerprints of the AP's.
    This work achieved comparable localization results but depending on

    In the scope of WiFi localization systems, it is still an open problem in the field of robotics to deal with this problem with off-the-shelf AP's, while resulting relatively higher localization results than other applications where NLoS observation can happen anytime.
